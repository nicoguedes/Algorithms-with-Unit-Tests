# Algorithms-with-Unit-Tests
C# .NET Core + xUnit - Simple way to show the power of Unit Tests by using well-known algorithms as examples.

## TDD - Test Driven Development

All the solutions were done following the TDD approach. First, I wrote the Unit Tests and just a stub Method. Initially the tests failed. Once you do that, it's time to work on the actual solutions aiming a successful test run.

### AlgorithmCollection

Console Application with some algorithm solutions.

### XUnitTests

Unit Tests for the Solutions.
